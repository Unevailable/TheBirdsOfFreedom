          &emsp; &emsp; The Bangladesh Liberation War was a war between West Pakistan and East Pakistan that resulted in the formation of Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively.  
					<br><br>
          
					&emsp; &emsp; The partition that separated India and Pakistan was due to the Two-Nation Theory that stated two religious groups cannot coexist because they are ‘separate nations’, the two groups being the Muslim majority in Pakistan and the Hindu majority in India. However, due to the cultural differences between East Bengal people and the peoples of what became West Pakistan, the Indian subcontinent was due for some trouble. When the West attempted to establish Urdu as the official language in the East, it sparked a linguistic and cultural backlash. Instead of religion, Bangladesh was established based on the culture and language of the people. People from all religions all fought for their freedom, unified by a shared language and culture.

					&emsp; &emsp; There are several key issues that added fuel to the fire and one of them was the fact East Pakistan was severely exploited because East Pakistan barely received any of the income is generated from exports. Another problem was that West Pakistan was more strict when it came to religion due to its overwhelming 97 percent Muslim population.  Bengalis, on the other hand, took pride in their literary works and cultural heritage in which non-muslim writers are held in high regard across the religious divide. Bengalis in East Pakistan became especially bitter when the official language for all of Pakistan was made Urdu while Bangla was spoken by the majority of people in East Pakistan. The Pakistan Army also failed to come to the aid of the Bengali populace when a tropical cyclone wiped out almost 5 million people, which further aroused hostility in the already angry Bengali citizens.

On March 25, the Pakistani Army launched a carefully designed plan called ‘Operation Searchlight’ to lessen the Bengalis' resistance to rule which was essentially a Genocide. All foreign journalists were removed from Bangladesh and Bengali Military personnel were disarmed before these crimes were committed.

					&emsp; &emsp;Following the executions on the night of March 25, the people started an armed battle against Pakistani occupying forces the very next day. On March 26, 1997, M. A. Hannan, a Chittagong-based Awami League politician delivered the first radio announcement of the declaration of independence. The declaration of independence, however, was signed on March 25, 1971, by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, one of the founding fathers of Bangladesh.
          <br><br>
          &emsp; &emsp; Therefore, March 26, 1971, is considered the official Independence Day; however, East Pakistan was recognized until the following December 16.
