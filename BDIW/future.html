        <p class="txt_one"> &emsp; &emsp; After a rough nine months during the Bangladesh Liberation War, Pakistan finally surrendered with nearly ninety-three-thousand troops in late 1971. During that year Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared independence to the country, making it the first Bangladesh government. The general in charge of the surrender was then looked down upon as a traitor as well as alienated. Bangladesh as a new country had little recognition, but the people were ecstatic to come together as one. In 1972, India and Pakistan signed a peace treaty called the “Shimla Agreement” which helped the Pakistani recognize East Pakistan as Bangladesh. However, the Pakistanis who had faced the worst military defeat of an army in decades will never forget this time of history. </p>

        <p class="txt_two"> &emsp; &emsp; Bangladesh is among the fastest-growing economies in the past decade and has outgrown Pakistan in terms of economic growth since 1971, with garment exports and a spike in remittances helping to propel the economy. In 2015, the country’s gross national income per capita was between $1,036 and $4,045, which classified the country as a lower-middle-income country. By 2026, Bangladesh is expected to be removed from the UN’s list of Least Developed Countries. And with how they’re developing it’s predicted that they’ll be a developed country by 2041. <br><br>
