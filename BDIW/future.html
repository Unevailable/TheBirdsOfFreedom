        <p class="txt_one"> &emsp; &emsp; This an interviewed report from Kabir Hussain—An Assistant Freedom Fighter—1971. <br><br> &emsp; &emsp; <q>South Asian subcontinent was partitioned into two countries after getting independence from the British empire in 1947: Pakistan (lands with a Muslim majority) and India (lands with a Hindu majority). Pakistan was consisted into two different territories: East Pakistan (the people and territory of East Bengal) and West Pakistan (the people and territory of West). The people of East Pakistan and West Pakistan were geographically, culturally, and ideologically distant and distinct.</q>

    <div class="p_two">
        <p class="txt_two"> &emsp; &emsp; <q>The movement of East Pakistan (East Bengal) grew up based on Bengali language, Bengal ethnic concerns, and the right to establish a desire for local political control and self-rule. December 07,1970, the seeds of political crisis was started, and it led to the liberation war when the Awami League (a powerful political party in East Bengal) won the substantial victory in Pakistan’s national elections. The leader of the Awami League party was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who campaigned for autonomy for East Bengal (East Pakistan) but General Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan’s People’s Party attempted to prevent the Awami League from forming the next government. </q>

        <p class="txt_three"> &emsp; &emsp; <q>March 25, 1971, after months of fruitless negotiations, Pakistani army was deployed to persuade a policy of reprisal targeting supporters of Bangladesh liberation and perceived enemies of the state and started killings of supporters and innocent people without any justification, so the civil liberation was then started.</q>

        <div class="p_four">
            <p class="txt_four"> &emsp; &emsp; <q>I was a student of 8th grade in Moynamoti Cantonment Comilla Public School for a while and was living there with my maternal uncle Abdur Rahman who was the then military (East Bengal Army) holding a position of “Nayek Sobeder.” Beginning of the war, Pakistani Army took him from home and killed immediately considering him as a supporter of liberation. His wife with two children (ages 2-5 years old) had to leave the Moynamoti cantonment for their own local house and walked for a month to reach there. They had no foods with them, only survived with the help of some villagers while was hungry, thirst and so much tired of walking a long way with fear of Pakistani army and of death, also had no transportation available at all. The Pakistani Army started killings of everyone (the innocent civilians) without any justification who they believe to be the supporter of the liberation. </q>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="p_five">
            <p class="txt_five"> &emsp; &emsp; <q>Finding no choice, many civilian even young school students had to take up the weapons to fight against the powerful Pakistani army. So, some of my cousins joined as freedom fighters had training crossing the border to India. As I was too young at that time, I joined as an assistant of some freedom fighters to help them in some specific operations. It had been a nightmare every single moment. We had to witness hundreds of innocent dead bodies (men and women and children) even walked over those dead bodies at night and day. After nine months of fierce fighting, on March 26, 1971, the desired independent day of Bangladesh came into lights and on December 16, 1971, the war was ended, Pakistani Army surrendered to the freedom fighters and victory was declared but the heartbreaking and bitter memories of liberation war is still alive which could never be forgotten.</q>
