        <p class="txt_one"> &emsp; &emsp; Amin, Ruhul was awarded the highest state insignia by the Bangladesh government for his sacrifice during the Liberation War. Ruhul was a soldier born in June 1935 at village Baghchapra in Begumgonj thana of Feni district. Ruhul sought his education to become a mechanical engineer for the Navy, which then led to his decision to participate at the beginning of the War of Liberation. On December 6, 1971, Ruhul traveled on a gunboat with his allies to capture Pakistan’s Naval Base. However, during the trip, they were caught in India’s fighter jet's crossfire and were told to immediately evacuate the boat. Ruhul then sacrificed his life for the boat and later on was caught and tortured to death by the Pakistani soldiers waiting for him onshore. </p>

        <p class="txt_two"> &emsp; &emsp; Jahangir Mohiuddin was a captain during the Liberation war, who sacrificed his life to retake the town of Nawabganj. Mohiuddin was born on March 7, 1949, where he grew up to become one of the 173rd Engineer Battalion at Saiydur Sharif and received the rank of captain by the age of twenty-one. During the war, Jahangir Mohiuddin’s mission was to advance toward the town of Nawabganj with the freedom fighters. However, Pakistan built and formed bunkers to keep them from entering. Mohiuddin then surprised the Pakistan army into retreating to the town, which then forced them to use their machine gun. The machine gun was a huge advantage for the Pakistani, but Mohiuddin single-handedly destroyed the machine gun with a grenade resulting in their victory and unfortunately his death. <br><br>

        <p class="txt_three"> &emsp; &emsp; Rameshwar Nath Kao was known to be the ‘architect of Bangladesh’ or one of the best “Spymasters”. Rameshwar Nath Kao was born on May 10, 1918, in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. R.N. Kao for short was the chief of India’s external intelligence agency, also known as (RAW). During the Liberation War in 1971, Kao supported the idea of having freedom in the country for East Pakistan. East Pakistan is now Bangladesh and If it wasn’t for Kao there wouldn’t have been that extra push for freedom. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi saw potential in Kao’s abilities and respected him for the aid. <br><br>

            <p class="txt_five"> &emsp; &emsp; Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, chief of the Indian Army played a critical role in their victory. Sam Manekshaw was born on April 3, 1914, in Amritsar, India. Sam Manekshaw was awarded India’s second and third highest civilian awards Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan for his indefinite leadership. Sam Manekshaw prevented an almost instant loss if it wasn’t for his decision to deny Indira Gandhi’s request. Indira Gandhi wanted to move his inexperienced army into East Pakistan to fight in the war. However, Sam Manekshaw denied it and demanded for a few months to train them. Of course, Indira Gandhi accepted, which later on led to their victory against the Pakistan army. Sam Manekshaw was the first Army officer of independent India to be honored with the rank of Field Marshal. </p>
